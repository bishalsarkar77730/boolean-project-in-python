# boolean-project-in-python
this project is based upon boolean concept 
first the program ask how many row you want to print for example 10
then they ask to choose one number 0 or 1 if you chose 1 the boolean value is true
then the stars print like this
"* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * * 
* * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * *"
if you chose 0 the boolean value of 0 is false
then the stars print like this  
"* * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * *
